# Calculatrix

This calculator application has been developed using the combination of Vite (a fast build tool for web development), Vanilla JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS (a utility-first CSS framework). The application allows users to perform basic calculations by inputting numeric values, selecting operations (+, -, *, /), and displaying real-time results. The project showcases the use of event handling, DOM manipulation, and styling with Tailwind CSS to create a modern and responsive user interface.
